# CHANGELOG

## 1.1.0 - 1.1.1

 * Added check to see if a Unix command is in path

## 1.2.0

 * the path to the log file that was loaded through au_config is attached to the config OStruct with symbol ":_config_file". This way
   the config file path can be used in a program

 known issues:
  - the config logger won't log anything, if no logger has been initialized
